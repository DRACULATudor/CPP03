# CPP Module 03 - 42 School

## Overview
This project is part of the **C++ Modules** at **42 School**, focusing on **inheritance and class hierarchy**. The goal is to understand **how base and derived classes work, access control (public, protected, private), and reusability** in object-oriented programming.

## Topics Covered

    Inheritance (Base & Derived Classes)
    Access Specifiers (public, protected, private)
    Code Reusability and Class Hierarchies
    Constructors and Destructors in Derived Classes
    Virtual Functions (Introduction to Polymorphism)


## Installation & Compilation

### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cpp-module-03.git
cd cpp-module-03
```
Compile the project:
```
make
```
Or, if there is no Makefile:
```
c++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98 *.cpp -o program
```
Run the program:
```
./program
```
## Usage
```
Run the compiled program to explore class inheritance, access control, and constructor/destructor behavior
